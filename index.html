        <h2>Welcome to the age of vikings</h2>
        <p>The Vikings were a seafaring people from the late eighth to early 11th century who established a name for themselves as traders, explorers and warriors. They discovered the Americas long before Columbus and could be found as far east as the distant reaches of Russia. 
        While these people are often attributed as savages raiding the more civilized nations for treasure and women, the motives and culture of the Viking people are much more diverse. These raiders also facilitated many changes throughout the lands from economics to warfare.</p>

            4 facts about vikings
            <div class="facts-left">
                <h4>They didn’t wear helmets with horns on</h4>
                <p>The iconic horned helmet that we know from popular culture was actually a fantastical creation dreamt up by costume designer Carl Emil Doepler for an 1876 production of Wagner’s Der Ring des Nibelungen.</p>

            <div class="facts-right">
                <h4>A Viking landed on American shores long before Columbus</h4>
                <p>Although we commonly credit Christopher Columbus with being the European who discovered the land that would become known as the “New World”, Viking explorer Leif Erikson beat him to it by a whopping 500 years.</p>

            <div class="facts.left">
                <h4>The Vikings kept slaves</h4>
                <p>Known as thralls, they carried out household chores and provided the labour for large-scale construction projects. New thralls were captured abroad by the Vikings during their raids and either taken back to Scandinavia or to Viking settlements, or traded for silver.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="facts-right">
                <h4>A sword was the most prized Viking possession</h4>
                <p>The craftsmanship involved in making them meant that swords were extremely expensive and therefore likely to be the most valuable item that a Viking owned – if, that is, they could afford one at all (most couldn’t).</p>
