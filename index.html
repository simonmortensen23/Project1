                <h4>They didn’t wear helmets with horns on</h4>
                <p>The iconic horned helmet that we know from popular culture was actually a fantastical creation dreamt up by costume designer Carl Emil Doepler for an 1876 production of Wagner’s Der Ring des Nibelungen.</p>

                <h4>A Viking landed on American shores before Columbus</h4>
                <p>Although we commonly credit Christopher Columbus with being the European who discovered the land that would become known as the “New World”, Viking explorer Leif Erikson beat him to it by a whopping 500 years.</p>

                <h4>The Vikings kept slaves</h4>
                <p>Known as thralls, they carried out household chores and provided the labour for large-scale construction projects. New thralls were captured abroad by the Vikings during their raids and either taken back to Scandinavia or to Viking settlements, or traded for silver.</p>

            <div class="facts-right-box">
                <h4>A sword was the most prized Viking possession</h4>
                <p>The craftsmanship involved in making them meant that swords were extremely expensive and therefore likely to be the most valuable item that a Viking owned – if, that is, they could afford one at all (most couldn’t).</p>
