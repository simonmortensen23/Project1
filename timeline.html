            <h2>The early days</h2>
            
                <h3>791: Raids begin on the British Isles</h3>
                <p>Early targets were Christian monasteries on small islands, which were often unprotected. One of the most famous early raids was in 793 at Lindisfarne, 
                    north east England. It was described by Anglo-Saxon writers as “Heathen men came and miserably destroyed God’s church on Lindisfarne, with plunder and slaughter,” according to English Heritage.</p>
            
            
                <h3>840: Norse settlers found Dublin</h3>
                <p>Or rather, they seized the ecclesiastical settlement and began to build a camps of their own, which would go on to become the capital of the Republic of Ireland.</p>

                <p>Vikings sailed up the Guadalquivir river to raid Seville. A Muslim army fought back, and the rapid Muslim response dissuaded the Vikings from further attacks on Spain</p>
            
            
                <h3>866: Vikings establish a Kingdom in York</h3>

                <h3>941: Rus Vikings attack Constantinople</h3>
                <p>The Rus and their allies took advantage of the Byzantine fleet and army being thinly spread. The Imperial capital essentially stood defenceless.
                     The Rus' were said to have violently killed their victims. It was one of many wars between the two sides</p>

                     Shortly after the meeting he survived a vicious attack, and duly converted. He returned to Norway to take the throne, and so began Norway's slow conversion</p>
            
                <h3>1000: Christianity arrives in Iceland and Greenland</h3>
                <p>Although the faith had already begun to spread, it really took hold when Norway's King Olav began to convert chieftains. He also imposed trade restrictions on those that refused</p>

                    Churches and shrines to Saint Olav were built in his honour across Europe. Some historians doubt the authenticity of the battle however, and say Olav could have been killed by his own people</p>
